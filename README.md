# Web Application Test
Assumptions:
* Used the search feature of the site since "All Products" page did not have the phone required.
* Multiple implicit waits to make sure that the page had rendered correctly.

Bugs:
* When hitting the "Purchase" Button without any information entered, the screen goes back to the shopping cart.
    **Expected Result: Page is to refresh and the errors to appear above the required fields
* The State text box disappears after coming back to the page.
    **Expected Result: text box to be present, while the drop down menu is not working.
